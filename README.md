## NBA Shooting Evolution (Pandas)
This project is based on player shooting data, a file which is part of the NBA stats dataset found on Kaggle (credit to Sumitro Datta, [link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sumitrodatta/nba-aba-baa-stats)). I have analysed how shooting trends in the NBA have changed over the last 26 years. 

## Victims of Homicides and Non-Fatal Shootings in the City of Chicago (PostgreSQL)
This project is based on the [dataset](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/violence-reduction-victims-of-homicides-and-non-fatal-shootings) regarding victims of homicides and non-fatal shootings in the Chicago area, published by the City of Chicago. The data has been slightly cleaned using Pandas and then divided using Microsoft Excel.
